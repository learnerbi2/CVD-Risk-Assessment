            <h3>I know you are Healthy, but your heart health is in a moderate range.<br>
                It’s never too late to improve your habits for a healthier heart.”<br>

            <p>Tips:<br>

                Get Moving:<br>
                Aim for 30 minutes of activity most days—try a brisk walk or a fun workout class.<br>
                If you’ve been sitting for a while, get up and move around every 30 minutes.   <br>
                
                Make Healthier Food Choices:<br>
                Cut back on fatty foods like fried or greasy foods, and focus on lean proteins like fish or beans.<br>
                Eat more heart-healthy foods like nuts, seeds, and oily fish (like salmon).<br>
                Watch how much salt you use, and try to add more fiber by eating whole grains and veggies.<br>
                
                Take Care of Your Mind:<br>
                Try stress-relieving activities like yoga, journaling, or just taking a quiet moment for yourself.<br>
                Make time for things you love.<br>
                whether that’s hobbies or just relaxing with friends.<br>
                
                Regular Health Checks:<br>
                Keep up with your check-ups and talk to your doctor about any concerns.<br>
                If you smoke, try to quit.<br>
                your heart will thank you!<br>
