            <p>Tips:<br>
                Stay Active:<br>
                Try to get moving for at least 30 minutes most days.<br>
                walking, biking, or swimming are great!<br>
                Don’t sit too long—take breaks to stretch or walk around now and then.<br>
                <br>
                Eat Smart:<br>
                Fill your plate with fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins.<br>
                Cut back on junk food, sugary drinks, and too much salt.<br>
                <br>
                Manage Stress:<br>
                Find ways to relax, like deep breathing or spending time with loved ones.<br>
                Make sure you’re getting enough sleep—7-9 hours a night helps you recharge.<br>
                <br>
                Keep an Eye on Your Health:<br>
                Get regular check-ups to monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol.<br>
                Drink water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support your heart.<br>
